        <h1>My Summer Vacation</h1>
      </div>
      <h3 class="text-center">Since my original making of this website, I have been on summer vacation,
      transitioning from my sophomore year of high school to my junior year. Over
      that summer break I have done quite a few interesting things, which I will
      share with you now.</h3>
      <h1 class="page-header">My Job</h1>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8">
          <p>For the month of July I worked at Howell Recreation as a camp counselor.
            I actually trained for this job two years ago (since covid prevented
            camp from being a thing last year), and so this is the first time that I
            am working as a full-blown counselor.<br>
            And let me say that they really gave me a memorable first year. So, I
            did my training with 5th graders, which I liked, since they were reasonably
            well-behaved and I liked them a lot. But this year, they gave me, my co-counselor,
            and my CIT a group of 1st graders. Let's just say that the difference in behavior was
            stark.
          </p>
          <p>But don't let this make you think that my time working at summer camp was
            bad, for it wasn't. I very much enjoyed what my group did there, and would
            love to do it again. We got to do a lot of interesting things, went
            on various trips together, and I liked my kids enough to enjoy the overall experience.</p>

        <h5><i id="CBunionCap">Image of view from Charlie's Bunion</i></h5>
        <p>Over the summer I went to the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/index.htm" target="_blank">Great Smoky Mountains National Park</a>
          for a week. If I could describe it in one word it would be: awesome!<br>
          There is just so much to do and to see there, and the mountains
          themselves are  absolutely amazing. We went hiking for three of the days that we
          were there, and I am so glad that we did. We saw some amazing sights down
          in this National Park.</p>
          <p>One of the best parts of our hiking experience was Charlie's Bunion, a rock
          on the side of this one mountain. It gives you an absolutely phenomenal view
          for miles around, making it very well worth the somewhat-strenuous trip.</p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-9">
              <p>Asides from the amazing experience of hiking the Smokies (as some
                people refer to it) there is still plenty more to do in this area. South
                of the National Park is the town of Cherokee, NC, where great food and culture
                can be explored in depth.</p>
                <p>And on the North side of the park, there is the town of Gatlinburg, TN. What's
                  interesting about this town is that it is essentially like a boardwalk strip for people in the mountains.
                  There is one main road that goes through the town, and on either side of
                  it are stores, eateries, ice cream shops, mini-golf, and tourist traps galore. It's great.
                  There's just so much to do and to see in this area as a whole that I would recommend it
                  to anyone and everyone.</p>

              <h1>Day-to-Day Life</h1>
            </div>
              <p>Work and vacations were not the only things that I did this summer.
              I also spent a lot of time with my family and friends. Whether it was
              going to a park or a mall, I had a good time with the people around me.
              My other passtimes include playing video games, reading (although
              summer reading was a big part of it), and watching some TV.</p>
              <p>But even when I wasn't doing anything that others would say is "interesting,"
              I still had a good summer overall. There was a nice balance of staying
              up late and catching some z's, being by myself and being with others,
              and staying home and going out.</p>
              <p>Really, that's what summer's all about. Doing what you choose to do
              because you're off from school. And as long as that's still true, I'll
              be a happy camper (pun definitely intended).</p>
